After years in the restaurant industry, I followed my passion into real estate in 2011, and I‚Äôve loved every minute since.\n\nAt Erba & Co, my wife and I built a team focused on making real estate honest, personal, and feel-good again. For me, it‚Äôs never just about homes and prices - it‚Äôs about lifestyle, family, and helping people move forward with confidence.",
